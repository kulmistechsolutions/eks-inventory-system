# ✅ Authorization Error - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

Sales & Technical users were getting this error:
```
❌ User role 'sales_tech' is not authorized to access this route
```

**The Problem:**
Many API routes only allowed `'admin'` users but should also allow `'sales_tech'` users.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

I updated **ALL** routes to allow `sales_tech` users access:

### **1. Products Routes** ✅
- ✅ GET `/api/products` - List products
- ✅ POST `/api/products` - Create product
- ✅ PUT `/api/products/:id` - Update product
- ✅ DELETE `/api/products/:id` - Delete product
- ✅ GET `/api/products/stats/summary` - Product stats

### **2. Sales Routes** ✅
- ✅ POST `/api/sales` - Create sale
- ✅ GET `/api/sales/stats/summary` - Sales stats

### **3. Repairs Routes** ✅
- ✅ POST `/api/repairs` - Create repair
- ✅ PUT `/api/repairs/:id` - Update repair
- ✅ POST `/api/repairs/:id/payment` - Add payment
- ✅ GET `/api/repairs/stats/summary` - Repair stats

### **4. Expenses Routes** ✅
- ✅ GET `/api/expenses` - List expenses
- ✅ GET `/api/expenses/:id` - Get expense
- ✅ POST `/api/expenses` - Create expense
- ✅ PUT `/api/expenses/:id` - Update expense
- ✅ DELETE `/api/expenses/:id` - Delete expense
- ✅ GET `/api/expenses/stats/summary` - Expense stats

### **5. Reports Routes** ✅
- ✅ GET `/api/reports/sales` - Sales report
- ✅ GET `/api/reports/repairs` - Repairs report
- ✅ GET `/api/reports/expenses` - Expenses report
- ✅ GET `/api/reports/inventory` - Inventory report
- ✅ GET `/api/reports/profit-loss` - Profit/Loss report

### **6. Debts Routes** ✅
- ✅ Already accessible (no changes needed)

### **7. Commissions Routes** ✅
- ✅ GET `/api/commissions/my-commission` - My commission (sales_tech)
