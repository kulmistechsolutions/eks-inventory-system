# ✅ User Registration & Login Issue - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

When you tried to add new users, they couldn't login because:

1. **Invalid Default Role** - The registration endpoint was using `'sales'` as default, but this role no longer exists
2. **Missing Commission Fields** - Commission fields weren't being saved for new users
3. **Role Mismatch** - Some routes still referenced old roles

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Fixed Registration Endpoint (`backend/routes/auth.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
role: role || 'sales'  // ❌ Invalid role
// No commission fields
```

**After:**
```javascript
role: role || 'sales_tech'  // ✅ Valid role
// Commission fields included
```

### 2. Fixed Sales Route (`backend/routes/sales.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
authorize('admin', 'sales')  // ❌ Old role
```

**After:**
```javascript
authorize('admin', 'sales_tech')  // ✅ New role
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend

**Stop the backend** (press `Ctrl+C`), then restart:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB Connected Successfully
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```
