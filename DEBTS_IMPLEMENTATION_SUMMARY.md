User fills form → API creates debt → Status = UNPAID → Balance = Amount Owed
```

### Add Payment
```
User adds payment → API updates debt → Recalculate balance → Update status
```

### Status Logic
```
amountPaid == 0 → UNPAID
0 < amountPaid < amountOwed → PARTIAL
amountPaid >= amountOwed → SETTLED
```
