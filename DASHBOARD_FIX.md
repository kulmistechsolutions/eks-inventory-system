# ✅ Dashboard Not Showing - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The dashboard was showing a blank page because:

1. ❌ **Undefined variable** - `isTechnician` was used but doesn't exist
2. ❌ **Should be** - `isSalesTech` (the new role name)

This caused a JavaScript error that prevented the dashboard from rendering.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### **Fixed Dashboard.tsx**

Changed all instances of `isTechnician` to `isSalesTech`:

**Before:**
```typescript
{(isAdmin || isTechnician) && (  // ❌ isTechnician doesn't exist
```

**After:**
```typescript
{(isAdmin || isSalesTech) && (  // ✅ Correct variable
```
