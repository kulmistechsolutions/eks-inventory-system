# 🔧 Fix: User Registration & Login Issue

## ❌ Problem

When adding new users, they couldn't login because:
1. Default role was set to `'sales'` (invalid)
2. Commission fields weren't being saved

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed the registration endpoint in `backend/routes/auth.js`:

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Changed default role from `'sales'` to `'sales_tech'`
2. ✅ Added commission fields handling
3. ✅ Commission fields only for sales_tech role

---

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend

**Stop the backend** (press `Ctrl+C`), then restart:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Now You Can Create Users!

### Create a New User

1. Login as **Admin** (admin@eks.com / admin123)
2. Go to **Users** page
3. Click **Add User**
4. Fill in:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Password
   - Role: **Sales & Technical**
   - Commission Type: **Percentage** or **Fixed**
   - Commission Value: e.g., 10 or 5
5. Click **Create**

### User Can Now Login!

The new user can login immediately with:
- Email: (the email you entered)
- Password: (the password you entered)

## 🧪 Test It

### Test 1: Create User
```bash
# Login as admin first
# Then create a new user via the UI
```

### Test 2: Login with New User
```bash
# Use the new credentials to login
# Should work perfectly!
```

---

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
role: role || 'sales'  // ❌ 'sales' is invalid
// No commission fields
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
role: role || 'sales_tech'  // ✅ Valid role
// Commission fields included for sales_tech
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

1. **Restart backend**
2. **Create a user** via the UI
3. **Try to login** with that user
4. **Should work!** ✅

---

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check Backend Logs

Look for errors in the backend terminal:
```
❌ Error: Invalid role 'sales'
```

If you see this, the backend needs to be restarted.

### Clear Old Data (Optional)

If you have old users with invalid roles:

```bash
# Option 1: Delete them via UI
# Go to Users page and delete old users

# Option 2: Delete via MongoDB
# Use MongoDB Compass or Atlas UI
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

After restarting backend:
- [ ] Backend is running
- [ ] Can create new users
- [ ] New users can login
- [ ] Commission fields are saved
- [ ] Users appear in Users page

**Restart your backend and try creating a user again!** 🚀
